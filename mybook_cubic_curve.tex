Cubic Curve\\
Cubic Curve is considered as the real points in $\mathbb{C}^{2}$
If they don't have double points they can be formed additive groups.
This means the points on the curve can be added. Surprisingly this addition is a geometric addition,
e.g. the sum $P + Q$ can be geometrically constructed from $P, Q$ and the curve.
In the case of cubic curve we have:
\[ 
    P + Q + R = 0  \\
    \Leftrightarrow \text{A straight line intersects the curve in } P, Q, R
\]
