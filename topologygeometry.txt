Def 12 In an oriental manifold 

the inserseciton # is independent of how we deform will be proved


Generelization 13
non-orientable situations(e.g. Ng) we can do the 

Theorem 16
L insert K = (-1)^kl K insert L  where k = dim(K), L = dim(L)
proof: 

Theorem 17
Let K, L be oriented, closed(compact without boundry) submanifolds
in an oriented manifold M, their intersection number is isotopy-invarient:
 If K_0 iso K_1 and L_o iso L_1
 then K_0 iso L_0 = K_1 iso L_1

Remark 19, the closedness hypothesis in Thm 17 is essential 
for submanfold with boundry, the intersection number may not be isotopy-invariant

Theorem 21, If closed K, and L can be disjoined by isotopy, then K inter L = intersection #
the converse is false

Cor 24.[generalization of Jordan curve theorem]
In R^m, every close hypersurface[of dim(m-1)] separated R^m into two parts 

Fixed point theorem
Suppose we need to solve some equation g(x) = 0, this can be algebraic, finite-difference, ordinary/partial differential...

Put f(x) = g(x) + x
    g(x) = 0 imply f(x) = x
Solve any equation is equivalent to finding fixed pt of some map
